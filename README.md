# Kid Pickup

## User Story

### Kid pick up is designed to help alleviate the stress and time that it takes to pick up your child from their school/instution by allowing parents to tell the school directly who is there and what child(ren) belongs to them. The school will then grab the child from the appropiate classroom. The child is then scanned using a barcode system ackknwledging that a staff memeber of the school has gotten the child and is on the way back to the pick-up line. The school staffer will then scan the "guardians" phone in order to acknowledge that the proper student was given to the guardian.

## Flow
1. When the parent/guardian is in parent pick-up line they will open the Kid Pickup app and after logging in the parent will then choose which school they are at and click a button stating that they are out in line for their child.
2. A school staff member will then be notified that X parent/guardian is out side with a picture and their tag number/car identification.
3. The staff memeber will then go to the approipate classrooms gathering the children for pickup.
4. After each child has been taken from their classroom the staff member will then scan the students tag. That will then notify the parent that theri child is on their way up to the line.
5. Once the the child and staff memeber is back with the parent/guardian the staff member will then scan the parents phone/tag to acknowledge the the child was realeased to the parent / guardian.
